# Note to Readers

Important notes that could be helpful to organize or use the scripts, will be listed out in this file.

This volume requires graphs generated from volume 1 & 2 to work properly.

## Known Issues

##### Tactics []?, and Other Unrecognized Tactics
Same as tactics in [volume 1](scripts/v1/readme.md), several new tactics have been found. Due to my limit, I cannot determine
the exact propositions that involve within. Below at the progress their appearances should be easily found,
and following the scripts their locations on the book also should be easily checked out. These tactics include:
- tactic Induct
- tactic []<=
- tactic []>=
- tactic []<

##### Proposition Not Found (labeled with `ERROR`s)
Same as in [volume 2](scripts/v2/readme.md), several propositions have not found their appearances:
- 225.174
- 331.124
- 372.152
