# Note to Readers

Important notes that could be helpful to organize or use the scripts, will be listed out in this file.

## Detectable Errors
Within the helper I have built a simple error checking system that checks errors while parsing the scripts. Errors that can be detected
includes:

1. General syntax errors that mentioned in [README.md](/README.md).
2. Propositions that don't exist in the database while reading a line.

Because of the nature(brutality), several types of critical errors cannot be detected. They include:
1. Wrong proof relation `a <- b`, assigning a proposition `a` to a proof proposition `b`, where the name `b` *exists* in the database.
2. Missing proof relations, tactics due to carelessness.
3. Missing proposition numbers not being recorded, which should occur at a very low chance.

## Comments are More Useful than You Think 

In some files, I write comments to indicate that, there might be some tactic not being added into the proof relation, because I haven't digested the tests so far yet. It can also be that, the original text has so much ambiguity that unless you comprehend the text, your proof relation might be completely go wrong. If I don't write these comment carefully, the situation would be worse - and sadly I am not a careful person.

## Known Issues

##### Tactic []=
Some proofs involve lines using `\[etc\] = proposition`. It's needed to figure out what theorem supports this abbrevation.

##### Tactic []<-
Similar to above, some proofs involve `\[etc\] <- proposition`. It appears at later chapter so it's harder to figure out.

##### Tactic Hp-Prop
`Hp` stands for hypothesis. Some proofs in very later chapters uses abbreviations like `Hp77.77` to indicate the hypothesis of proposition `77.77`.

##### Similar Proof
Some proofs are omitted and written "similar proof" only. It's severely ambiguous, and the actual proof relation can be known only after one has comprehended the texts.
For tactics above, I have a chance to label those tactics as clearly as I can in comments. But for similar proof, I might be very careless... It's recommended to
check through original text to figure out where `similar proof` has been used to abbreviate the texts.

##### Missing Dot
On page 470, Thm 74.3, there's a line of proof writing `10 11.23.35`. It cannot be determined whether this happens from missing a dot, or misplacing a space.

##### Alternative Proof
Some propositions might be provided more than one proofs. My current way to manage with the proof relation recording is writing both sets of relations in the scripts, but commenting out one of them. 

##### Dft
Dft appears in the very later chapters of the texts, and I cannot understand its meaning. It seems to be different from Df, Thm or Pp, and the real meaning remains to be figured out. 

##### Volatile Ch.8
Most proofs in chapter 8 in Appendix A are given in texts, and in a lot of cases the proofs mention other propositions as "similar proof". Without these mentions, the proofs contain no propositions at all.

##### Tactics with subscripts(___)
There could be some connectives being added subscript(s), and the use of these connectives are being recognized as using 
a tactic. One example is the `[]<->___` in chapter 40. Currently I have found out that they act as an abbreviation of 
`forall`, as stated in page 22:
```
Fx (->_x) Gx <-> forall x. (Fx -> Gx) Df
```
Since it's a collection of tactics, I won't give complete treatment in the forseeable future to identify exact 
definitions to the connective abbreviations. However, I have made NOTES on where they're being used.

## Useful Cypher Snippets

Color the nodes by chapters(APOC library required):
````cypher
MATCH (n:Prop)
WITH DISTINCT n.chapter AS chapter, collect(DISTINCT n) AS props
CALL apoc.create.addLabels(props, [apoc.text.upperCamelCase(chapter)]) YIELD node
RETURN *
````

Change password:
````cypher
ALTER USER neo4j SET PASSWORD 'neo4j'
````

Export whole database to JSON object(APOC library required):
````cypher
CALL apoc.export.json.all("pm.json",{useTypes:true})
````
Find the json object under the database's `import/` folder, or open the project's `import` folder from settings.
